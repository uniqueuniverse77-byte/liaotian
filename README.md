### What makes LiaoTian (LT) so special from already existing social media/networking platforms?

This is a project where **anyone can easily fork/clone and deploy their own** versions of this platform. This GitHub repository provides a sort of boilerplate template for making your own such platforms, in a way.
Unlike Mastodon and other open-source and decentralized or fediverse alternatives like this, the code is **compiled into a static site**, meaning it can be easily **hosted on most free hosting providers** for $0. All it needs is a database connection via Supabase. The content **behaves as if it is dynamic and real-time**, thanks to both Vercel (as what we have used) and Supabase's real-time API features.
Also to get started on developing your own version of LiaoTian, it's much simpler than most other "templates" out there, since it uses **only 7 files** for its actual codebase (as of now).
